## Data Structures Questions

Here are some questions and answers you may encounter in your interview process. I have tried as much as possible to curate the answers from every source I could come across.

### What is a data structure?

_Data Structure_ is a way of organizing data in a way that makes it easy to perform operations on the data. It also defines the way different sets of data relate to one another, establishing relationships and forming algorithms.

### What are the different types of data structures?

There are two types of data structures:
_Linear data structure_: A data structure that is composed of a sequence of elements or a linear list e.g. Arrays, Linked list, stacks, queues. The elements are stored in a non-hierarchical way so that each item has successors and predecessors except the first and last element in the list.
_Non-linear data structure_: If the elements of a data structure results in a way that traversal of nodes is not done in a sequential manner, then it is a non-linear data structure e.g. Trees, Graphs, Tables, Sets.

### What are some applications of data structures?

Data structures form the core of software programming as any efficient algorithm is dependent on how data is structured. The following are some of the areas where data structures are used:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Compiler design
- Machine learning
- Database design and management
- Blockchain
- Numerical and statistical analysis
- Operating systems development
- Image and speech processing
- Cryptography

### What are the benefits of learning data structures?

Software programming problems have time constraints(how fast can you solve the problem) and space constraints(how much space you need to solve the problem). In order to solve the problem, it is essential for a problem to be represented in a proper structured format upon which efficient algorithms can be applied.

> Understanding the different kinds of data structures available helps a programmer to understand the problem and to solve it efficiently.

While the core concepts of data structures remains the same across languages, the implementation differs based on syntax and semantics.
In _procedural languages_ like C, implementation is done with the help of structures, pointers.
In _object oriented languages_ like Java, implementation is done with the help of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism.
